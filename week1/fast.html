<p><a href="index.html">Starvation and speed. Noun and adjective.</br>
This is where I get caught.</br> A fast is the opposite of desire.</br> It is the negation of desire. It is what I feel after we fight.</br>
The speed does us in. We act rashly, we say too much,</br>
we don't let all the synapses connect before we do the thing </br>we shouldn't do.
</br>You make it a production. Slam doors.</br> Knock things over. Scream.
</br> But I just leave.</br> Even if I'm still standing there, I leave.</br>
I am refusing you. I am denying you. </br>I am an adjective that is quickly turning into a noun.
